# RL_PPO_in_Vectorized_Robotic_Environments

## Objective
This project delves into implementing and analyzing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in vectorized robotic environments, such as those provided by Mujoco and BRAX. The primary goal is to develop a PPO agent from scratch and evaluate its performance in various complex environments.

## Methodology

1 - Understand basic of Reinforcement Learning 

2 - Code a Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm

3 - Implement the algorithm in various environment

  a) Inverted Pendulum Mujoco environment.

  b) Humanoid Mujoco environment
